* This project simulates an ongoing software project for a desktop application (called _SilverCare_) used for providing nurses with an easier time in managing contacts of their home visit patients.
  * It is **written in OOP fashion**. It provides a **reasonably well-written** code base **bigger** (around 6 KLoC) than what students usually write in beginner-level SE modules, without being overwhelmingly big.
  * It comes with a **reasonable level of user and developer documentation**.
* It is named `SilverCare` because it reflects our commitment to providing specialised support for elderly patients and the nurses who care for them during home visits
* For the detailed documentation of this project, see the **[SilverCare Product Website](https://ay2425s2-cs2103t-t12-4.github.io/tp/)**.
* This project is based on the AddressBook-Level3 project created by the [SE-EDU initiative](https://se-education.org).
